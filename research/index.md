**I. Study on biochemical and biophysical interactions by real-time gas-phase techniques**
<br>
This project uses gas-phase ion-molecule reaction techniques, in conjunction with computational chemistry, to probe biophysical and biochemical processes. One of such research efforts is directed toward probing the chemistry of biomolecule photooxidation and oxidative post-translational modifications. Photooxidation of biomolecules by reactive oxygen species is an important biological process associated with aging, disease and photodynamic therapy for cancer, and is also related to the photochemical transformations of atmospheric biomolecule aerosols. Most of photooxidation experiments have been carried out in solution, with various reactive oxygen species generated simultaneously via photosensitization. The inability to unambiguously distinguish the individual roles of various reactive oxygen species in solution, together with the large number of coupled experimental variables (sensitizers, oxygen, solvent, pH, light wavelength, etc.), makes the interpretation of mechanism complicated.

On the other hand, gas-phase techniques offer unique approaches that isolate the interactions, which not possible in solution.  Gas-phase experiments can distinguish between singlet oxygen and radical-mediated processes, identify early intermediates, quantify transient species and products, and focus on intrinsic reactivity of biomolecules.  Resulting insights can then be extrapolated to solution models by incorporating hydration effects at two different levels: by clustering of biomolecules with water in the gas phase, and by comparing with solution experiments.

**Experimental Techniques** : Biomolecular ions are generated by electrospray ionization (ESI). Ion-molecule reactions between biomolecular ions and neutral reactive species are carried out using guided-ion-beam scattering methods. Experimental measurement includes reaction cross sections, product branching. Measurement of differential cross sections (i.e., recoil energy and angular distributions of products) is also possible. The main instrument employed for this project is a versatile guided-ion-beam tandem mass spectrometer, useful both for ion-molecule dynamics, and as a general-purpose analytical instrument for solution-phase experiments.
